- Use EXPLAIN keyword to see the execution plan of the query
- check index usage and check rows scanned

- Use limit 1 clause when retrieving a unique row
- Use limit order by to replace min and max

- Try to Convert <> to = operator it increases the chances of index usage

- Avoid select * it ignores the index and waste the network bandwidth

- Split big DELETE, UPDATE, INSERT into multiple smaller queries
- Use appropriate data types for columns (smaller columns are faster)

- Mysql query cache is case and space sensitive. use same query case for repeat queries

- Index columns in where clause and join clause (use best judgement)

- Use union all of possible over union
- Table order does not matter when inner join is used
- If column used in order by clause are indexed they help with performance

- Use limit and offset to implement pagination


- There can be multiple ways to write a query to produce the same result set.
- It is possible that one method works for one query where as another method works for another query

- Always test your query with near real data and schema on your development server before deploying to prod
